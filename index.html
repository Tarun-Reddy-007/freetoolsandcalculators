              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">6. Can I use calculators offline?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">If you load a page once, many functions continue working offline until a refresh—ideal for travel or limited connectivity.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">7. Are there ads or tracking scripts?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Minimal ads help keep tools free; we avoid invasive tracking and do not sell user-entered data (none is stored).</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">8. How is user privacy protected?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">No accounts, no cloud submission, fully client-side processing—your inputs vanish when you close the tab.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">9. Can I request a new calculator or feature?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Yes—submit suggestions through the contact route or repository issue; popular requests get prioritized.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">10. Do you provide an API for integration?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Not currently; future roadmap may include a lightweight read-only API for selected calculators.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">11. Can I embed a tool on my website?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Embeds/IFRAME snippets are under consideration; until then you may link directly to individual tool pages.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">12. Why do results sometimes differ from other sites?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Variation in formula versions, rounding rules, or input assumptions (e.g., activity multipliers) can produce minor differences.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">13. Do you support dark mode or accessibility features?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Accessibility guidelines (contrast, labels) are followed; dark mode and font-size controls are planned enhancements.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">14.

Are formulas for health tools medically certified?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">They implement publicly documented equations (e.g., Mifflin-St Jeor for BMR); not a substitute for professional diagnostics.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">16. How do you handle rounding and precision?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Displayed results are rounded for readability; internal calculations keep higher precision before formatting output.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">17. What if I find an error in a calculator?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">Report via contact or repo issue with details (inputs, expected vs actual). Corrections are usually deployed quickly.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">18. Are results stored for history or analytics?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">No—there is no server retention or personalized history; privacy-first design keeps usage ephemeral.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">19.

              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">20. Can I trust the password strength checker?</h3><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><p itemprop="text" style="font-size:.92rem;">It estimates complexity client-side using entropy heuristics—never sends your password; still choose unique credentials.</p></div></div>
              <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><h3 itemprop="name" style="font-size:1.05rem;">21.
