# robots.txt for FreeToolsandCalculators
# Last updated: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Provide clear crawl directives and assist search engines in efficiently indexing public calculator pages.
# Notes:
# 1. All category and tool pages are meant to be indexed.
# 2. 404 page is marked noindex via meta; we also disallow it to reduce crawl waste.
# 3. If you add a sitemap.xml later, update the Sitemap directive below (uncomment it).

User-agent: *
# Allow everything by default
Allow: /

# Optional: prevent indexing of the custom 404 document
Disallow: /404.html

# Block Firebase config file from being indexed (not useful to users)
Disallow: /firebase.json

Sitemap: https://freetoolsandcalculators.com/sitemap.xml

# Performance: Avoid setting crawl-delay unless your server becomes overloaded.
# If you ever need it, add (example): Crawl-delay: 2

# End of file
